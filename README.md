## ‚öôÔ∏è **How it Works**

### 1. **Fetching Stock Data Using Yahoo Finance API**

Stock data is collected from Yahoo Finance through parallel processing and stored in Pinecone for efficient retrieval.

### 2. **User Query Input**

Users interact with the app via the Streamlit UI, where they describe the type of stocks they are looking for in natural language. Optional filters like Market Cap, Volume, and Recommendation Keys can be applied to refine the search.

### 3. **Generating Embeddings**

The user query is converted into a high-dimensional vector using HuggingFace's Sentence-Transformers, capturing the semantic meaning of the input for better matching.

### 4. **Vector Search with Pinecone**

The generated embedding is sent to Pinecone, where it searches through the vector database for relevant stock data. Filters are applied to narrow the search results, ensuring only the most relevant stocks are returned.

### 5. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

The retrieved stock data is formatted into a context block, which is combined with the original user query and sent to OpenAI‚Äôs language model to generate a detailed, context-aware response.

### 6. **Displaying Results**

The top stock matches, along with their key financial metrics (e.g., Revenue Growth, Gross Margins, Market Cap, etc.), are displayed in an interactive format. Missing or malformed data is handled gracefully to ensure a smooth user experience.
